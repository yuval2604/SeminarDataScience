DataScience Seminar

We are Yuval (206587982) and Gabriella (XXXXXXXX), young computer science students who are passionate about data science.
When we were thinking what project we would like to be doing this semester, we instantly knew that we want to learn something new.
Since we both never had a project with Data science and Machine learning, and since we both are passionate about the medicine world - when we browsed Kaggle for an open competition, a competition related to diagnosing cancer intrigued us immediately.
We took the data from Wisconsin University Data Set, those features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
The competition's purpose is to Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/feature. We used 30 features, amoung them are :

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

We learned that this dataset is 8 times bigger than any previously publicly released dataset. It is still fresh and the competition is still open.

When we dove a little deeper we discovered it was even more challenging than we thought - with a massive, unclean dataset that does not fit into memory - we were very excited and a little bit intimidated.
