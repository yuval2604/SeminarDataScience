import liberies
get data from the csv
present the data

In this case we use the SVM algoritem

Train the data
Imporove the model

Fix little bugs :
Miss range_train

# - Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features

- 30 features are used, examples: - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) - perimeter - area - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) - symmetry - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

- Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features
- Number of Instances: 569
- Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
- Target class: - Malignant - Benign
